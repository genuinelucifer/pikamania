My first mario like game using C++ and SDL which has 4 levels and many other things like bonus and weapon! ^_^

For building the code, SDL version 1 library will be required.
Also to run it one would need the 'data' folder which was too large to upload here.
More abour building and running is given in "About Code.txt" file!
